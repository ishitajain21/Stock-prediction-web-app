# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices based on user-inputted ticker symbols. The model is trained on historical stock data and can forecast future prices, displaying the predictions alongside actual prices on a web application.

## Overview

The key features of this project include:

1. Developing an LSTM model using Keras to predict stock prices, trained on 50 epochs with 5 layers, achieving 53% accuracy and 0.0018 loss.
2. Utilizing Scalars to standardize time-series data with a factor of 0.0137 to handle outliers.
3. Creating a user-friendly Streamlit web application to input ticker symbols and display predicted versus actual stock prices.
4. Deploying the web application using Python.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit web application: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Input a stock ticker symbol in the provided field.
3. The application will fetch historical data, preprocess it, and use the LSTM model to generate price predictions.
4. The predicted and actual stock prices will be displayed on an interactive graph.

## Future Enhancements

Several improvements and additional features are planned for this project:

- Incorporate datetime features in the graphs and prediction step for better context.
- Address the lag between predicted and actual prices to improve accuracy.
- Shift the model from regression to binary classification (price going up or down) for potentially higher accuracy.
- Include a feature to recommend whether the user should buy, sell, or hold the stock.
- Extend the model to predict cryptocurrency prices in addition to stocks.
