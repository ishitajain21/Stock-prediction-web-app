Created LSTM model to predict stock price based on user-inputted ticker symbol. 
Followed pattern of stock market well with a slight lag. 
Displayed data in an easy-to-read way on web app. 

Future feautures: 
- Incoporate daetime feautures in the graphs and the prediction step.
- Learn to address the lag between prediction and actual prices. (improve accuracy) 
- Shift the model from regression to binary classification (is price going up or down) as that will have higher accuracy.
- Include feauture to tell user whether to sell, buy, or hold stock.
- Apply to Crypto coins.
